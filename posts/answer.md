## Plot

"Answer" is a 1948 short story by American Sci-Fi author Frederic Brown. It focuses on two characters, Dwan Ev and Dwar Reyn, as they are about to activate a supercomputer that will connect all civilization. 

> "all of the monster computing machines of all the populated planets in the universe -- ninety-six billion planets -- into the supercircuit that would connect them all into one supercalculator". 

Dwar Ev flips the switch, and the massive supercomputer, surging with power, turns on. He then lets Dwar Reyn ask the computer its first question.

> "It shall be a question which no single cybernetics machine has been able to answer. "He turned to face the machine. "Is there a God?" 

The supercomputer replies by saying "Yes, now there is a God." Fear grips Dwar Ev and he leaps to shut down the supercomputer. 

A bolt of lightning from "a cloudless sky" strikes Dwar Ev down, leaving the supercomputer on."

## My Thoughts
Frederic Brown was a master at effectively using one to three pages to convey a theme that would stay in your mind longer after the time it took to read the story. 

In "Answer", Brown does exactly this, and perfectly encompasses mankind's fears about advancing technology. How long can we keep up technology, until it becomes our undoing?
