I've used a couple blogging systems over my two years owning sysnomid.com. Each has had its own perks and downsides that I'll cover.

In the beginning of sysnomid.com, there was WordPress. 

WordPress is an open source Content Management System or CMS, made in 2003. It is an incredibly extensive system able to create essentially any site under the sun, everything from shops, blogs, portfolios, wikis, forums, the list goes on. This extensibility makes it the most popular CMS, [powering more than 30% of the internet](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress).

My experience with WordPress has been pretty positive, but I never really got into editing themes or really getting into the codebase at all. 

WordPress is a case of Technical vs. Personal/Business functionality, the backend code is well ... a mess. But WordPress provides a free and easy way to get tons of functionality for business and personal users. Case in point, WordPress's massive plugin and theme ecosystem, for regular users, this provides them with all the tools to build just about anything they want. 

Eventually though, I wanted a more minimal and better customizable system.
