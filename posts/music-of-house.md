House M.D. is one of my favorite TV shows and such it also has introduced to some of my new favorite music.

The show is focused on Dr. Gregory House, played by Hugh Laurie, the acerbic Director of Diagnostic Medicine at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. House leads his team to a diagnosis with his sharp wit and unconventional tactics.

House M.D, along with its stellar acting, excellent writing, hilarious scenes and emotionally compelling episodes, also has great music. Music helps propel the narrative and gives a closer look into House and the rest of characters in the show. Here is a list of some of my favorite music of the show.
